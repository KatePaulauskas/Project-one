## Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The fully responsive navigation bar is displayed on all site pages. It includes the Aerial Photography logo on the left and links to three site pages aligned to the right: Home, Projects, and Contact.
  
  - The design of the navigation bar remains consistent across all pages for flawless and seamless navigation. It allows site visitors to navigate through the site pages with ease, eliminating the need to use the back button in their browser.
  
  - The logo in the navigation bar features an image of a drone above the Aerial Photography abbreviation. The abbreviation and the image are divided by a horizontal line representing the horizon. This design of the logo provides a clear visual hint about the site's focus on aerial photography.

  - The navigation bar has an orange background, inspired by the Irish flag's color palette, to represent the Irish theme. The Logo and Menu links are in black, creating a great contrast with the orange background. The navigation bar stands out on the site, looking like a separate section, which stands out from the rest of the page.


    ##### Mobile
    
    - On mobile devices, the menu is represented by a hamburger icon. Clicking on it the menu dropdown opens right below the header, showcasing the current page in bold and underlined to ensure smooth navigation. The menu items are displayed on an orange background taking the width of the screen and creating one block with the header.

    - The mobile navigation bar was created to be intuitive and easy to use. When a site page is selected, the menu dropdown disappears from the page. This provides a clean look on mobile without obstructing the page and ensures that the limited space of the mobile screen is used wisely. To access the menu items again, the site visitor needs to click on the menu icon.

    ![Thank You Page](media/thank-you-page.png)

### Features Left to Implement

  - It would be beneficial to further improve the code on the 'Thank You' page for larger screens, to ensure that the video fits within the page in such a way that there is no vertical scrolling. This could allow the site visitors to have easy access to the control panel of the video without the need to scroll down the page to reach the controls.
  
    #### Potential features to be implemented to further develop the project
    
  - It could be beneficial to develop a content management system and add a login bar for the member's area. This feature would enable business owners and photographers to log into the site and upload fresh content on the new and existing projects section directly without the need to go to the back end of the site and edit it.
  

## Testing

  - The site was tested in various browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Brave, and no issues were identified with loading the site or browsing through the site pages.
  
  - The project appears responsive and presentable, it performs full functionality on all standard screen sizes using the DevTools device toolbar and when tested through such tools as [BrowserStack Responsive Design Testing](www.browserstack.com/) and [Website Planet Responsive Checker](https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/responsive-checker/).
  
  - Upon physically checking the site on multiple devices one issue was identified. When the project is viewed on a 13-inch screen in a browser with a bookmarks bar present, the content is pushed down and the tagline is not readable. This means that a new media query needs to be created to shift the hero text up.

  - 13-inch screen in Microsoft browser without bookmarks bar
  
    ![13-inch screen in Microsoft Edge browser without bookmarks bar](media/13-inch-no-bookmarks-bar.png)

- 13-inch screen in Chrome browser with bookmarks bar present
  
    ![13-inch screen in Chrome browser with bookmarks bar](media/13-inch-with-bookmarks-bar.png)

Below is a summary of the issues identified and corresponding corrections made:

  - __Issue 1:__ 64 - header - 'top' is not a 'align-items' value: 'top'

    ```

    - Comment: This is an external stylesheet provided by Google fonts and it is beyond our control to check it



- __Accessibility__

    To ensure the accessibility requirements are met for the current project, the Lighthouse testing was done for mobile and desktop versions of the site.

  - Mobile

    - Initially, the test did not return high results for site performance on mobile, providing a score of 56. Whereas accessibility results were 100, which ensures that the fonts and colors chosen for this project are easy to read.
  
    ![Lighthouse test on mobile](media/lighthouse-mobile.png)

    - After resizing the hero image and logo on mobile, as well as converting the logo file to WebP format, the performance indicator was significantly improved.

    ![Lighthouse second test on mobile](media/lighthouse-mobile-test-two.png)

    - Desktop

    - The Lighthouse test returned great results for the desktop version of the site, confirming that the site is fully accessible, has great performance and SEO settings, and uses best practices.

    ![Lighthouse test on desktop](media/lighthouse-desktop.png)
    
    ##### Site Colors Accessibility
    
    Site colors were checked for accessibility to ensure they are color-blind safe using the [Adoby Color accessinility tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility):
    
    ![Color blind safe test](media/color-blinnd-safe.png)

    Additionally, site text and icon colors were tested against their backgrounds for contrast using the [Adoby Color Contrast Checker](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer).
    
      - Header: 
    ![Contrast checker header](media/contrast-checker-header.png)
        
      - Page body:
    ![Contrast checker page body](media/contrast-checker-page-body.png)

      - Footer:
  
        White on the green is only used for graphic components in the footer, such as social media icons, therefore there are no issues with this color combination:
    ![Contrast checker footer](media/contrast-checker-footer.png)

        
        
    
  
### Solved Bugs

- Menu dropdown on mobile
  - It was noticed that there is a gap appearing between the navigation bar and the dropdown menu on mobile. This was because the header did not have a bottom border set:

    ```
    header {
    background-color: #FF8200;
    padding: 0 0;
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 99;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: top;
    padding-right: 0px;
    height: 75.4px;
    margin: 0;
    }
    ```
    
    ![Navigation bar without border bottom](media/navigation-bar-mobile-before-with-the-gap.png)

  - In an attempt to fix this issue, a bottom border matching the color of the navigation bar was added, but a small gap remained:
                ```
                    border-bottom: 2px solid #FF8200;
                ```
    
    ![Navigation bar with orange border bottom](media/navigation-bar-mobile-border-bottom-orange.png)
  
  - In order to test the issue the color of the bottom border was changed to black, and the gap completely disappeared:
                ```
                    border-bottom: 2px solid #000000;
                ```

  - It was decided to change the bottom border color to dark orange instead of the orange of the navigation bar since the gap persisted with the orange color. The dark orange color, in contrast to black, maintains the clean and aesthetically pleasing look of the navigation bar. Once the color was changed to dark orange, the issue with the gap no longer persisted:

                border-bottom: 2px solid #E67500;
                ```

### Shortcomings

- Form Submission

    To keep the consistent look and style of the site as well as exceptional user experience, it was decided not to send form submissions to the external link of the Code Institute. Instead, it was decided to direct site visitors to a hidden page on the site to ensure the site visitors stay on the site and are not directed to an external link. In an attempt to display form submission using instructions from [W3Schools](<https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp>) the following files were created: process-form.php and display-results.php and appropriate code was used. However, later on, it was discovered, that backend is not available on this project. Therefore, the created files were deleted and replaced with the ‘Thank You’ page, which includes a thank you message, without a presentation of the results submitted.

- Image preload

    Although site performance has a high score on desktop, it was noticed that the hero image might sometimes take a second to load and the home page appears blank. To resolve this, ideally, a blurred image should be loaded immediately. However, since only HTML and CSS are used for this project, implementing such a feature with a blurred image would not be possible. To ensure that the overlaying text on the image is readable and does not blend with the page background when the image loads, and to avoid the impression that the page is empty, a background color was added to the hero section. The color was picked from the hero image and partially imitated the blurred effect of the image.

## Deployment

  - The current project was deployed to GutHub pages through the following deployment steps:
    1. I navigated to the settings tab in the GitHub repository.
    2. In the Code and automation section on the left-hand sidebar, I selected Pages.
       - I set Source to 'Deploy from a branch'.
       - Selected main branch in the dropdown.
       - Set the folder to / (root).
       - Clicked Save.
    3. I went back to the Code tab. Waited a few minutes and refreshed my repository.
    4. After that on the right-hand side, I located the Deployments section and clicked on 'github-pages'.
    5. I clicked on the square with an arrow pointing to the upper right corner against the last deployment on the right and was able to see my project live.

## Credits

### Content
  - The text for the home page was generated using [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
  - To select the fonts for the site, a font pairing service was used: [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/).
  - Paired font families were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
  - Site colors accessibility was checked using [Adobe Color Accessibility Tool](<https://color.adobe.com/>).
  - Icons displayed in the footer and animated icons displayed on the Home and Projects pages were taken from [Iconify](https://iconify.design).
  - Irish flag color codes were taken from [FlagColorCodes.com](https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/ireland).
  - Vertical dividers between menu items on larger screens were added using instructions from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1936661/vertical-dividers-on-horizontal-ul-menu).
  - To create hidden headings the instruction from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/accessibility_heading_levels.php) was used.
  - Form submissions were attempted to be displayed through PHP form handling using instructions from [W3Schools](<https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp>), however, eventually the setup was not used due to the project's backend limitation.
  - To allow text wrapping when a site visitor types in the text box 'Add your message' on the 'Contact' page, 'textarea' tag was used following instructions from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp).
- To ensure that the video in the iframe on the 'Thank you' page is muted, autoplay, loops, has a specific quality set, and does not display suggested videos, the instructions from the folloing resources were used: [Google support](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780), [DevSheet](https://devsheet.com/code-snippet/play-youtube-video-in-loop-html-iframe/), [DEV](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/a-quick-note-on-embedding-a-youtube-video-in-2021-4h9d).
  - To ensure that video aspect ratio is maintained on the 'Thank You' page, the instructions from the following sources were utilised: [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-iframes/) and [Nikita Hlopov Frontend Dev Blog](https://nikitahl.com/css-aspect-ratio) were used.

### Media

  - Personal media and video files were used to build the current project.
  - [Wix Logo Maker](https://www.wix.com/logo/maker) was used to design Aerial Photography project logo.
