## Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The fully responsive navigation bar is displayed on all site pages. It includes the Aerial Photography logo on the left and links to three site pages aligned to the right: Home, Projects, and Contact.
  
  - The design of the navigation bar remains consistent across all pages for seamless navigation. It allows site visitors to navigate through the site pages with ease, eliminating the need to use the back button in their browser.
  
  - The logo in the navigation bar features an image of a drone above the Aerial Photography abbreviation, divided by a horizontal line representing the horizon. This design provides a clear visual hint about the site's focus on aerial photography.

  - The navigation bar has an orange background, inspired by the Irish flag's color palette, to represent the Irish theme. The Logo and Menu links are in black, creating a stark contrast with the orange background. The navigation bar stands out on the site, looking like a separate section, clearly delineated from the rest of the page.


    ##### Mobile
    - On mobile devices, the menu is represented by a hamburger icon. Clicking on it opens a dropdown menu right below the header, displaying the current page in bold and underlined for smooth navigation. The menu items are on an orange background, taking the width of the screen and forming one block with the header.

    - The mobile navigation bar is intuitive and easy to use. When a site page is selected, the menu dropdown disappears, providing a clean look and ensuring wise use of the limited mobile screen space. To access the menu items again, the site visitor needs to click on the menu icon.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

- The site was tested in various browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Brave, and no issues were identified with loading the site or browsing through the pages.
  
- The project is fully responsive; it looks presentable and retains full functionality on all standard screen sizes, tested using both the DevTools' device toolbar and multiple devices. However, one issue was identified during testing: when the project is viewed on a 13-inch screen in Chrome browser with a bookmarks bar present, the content is pushed down, making the tagline on the home page unreadable. This indicates that a new media query is needed to shift the hero text upwards for better visibility.

  - 13-inch screen in Microsoft browser withithout bookmarks bar
  
    ![13-inch screen in Microsoft Edge browser without bookmarks bar](media/13-inch-no-bookmarks-bar.png)

  - 13-inch screen in Chrome browser with bookmarks bar present

    ![13-inch screen in Chrome browser with a bookmarks bar present](media/13-inch-with-bookmarks-bar.png)


- The navigation bar and menu items are intuitive, easy to use, and understand.

- The contact form is fully functional, with every field requiring an entry, including the email field which only accepts email addresses. The submit button is fully operational.

### Shortcomings
To maintain a consistent look and style for the site and ensure an exceptional user experience, the decision was made to avoid redirecting form submissions to the [external link of the Code Institute](https://formdump.codeinstitute.net). Instead, site visitors were supposed to be directed to a hidden page within the site, keeping them engaged on-site and preventing redirection to an external link. Initially, the strategy was to display form submissions by following instructions from  [W3Schools](<https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp>), leading to the creation of two files: process-form.php and display-results.php, with the appropriate code implemented. However, it was later discovered that backend support is not available for this project. Consequently, these files were removed and replaced with a 'Thank You' page, which displays a message of gratitude, however  does not show the results of the submissions.

- process-form.php
```
<?php
session_start();

// Collect form data
$_SESSION['name'] = $_POST['name'];
$_SESSION['email'] = $_POST['email-address'];
$_SESSION['message'] = $_POST['add-your-message'];

</body>
</html>
// Redirect to the results page
header('Location: display-results.php');
exit();
?>
```

- display-results.php
```
<?php
session_start();

// Check if the session variables are set
if (isset($_SESSION['name']) && isset($_SESSION['email']) && isset($_SESSION['message'])) {
    // Display the results
    echo "<h1>Form Submission Results</h1>";
    echo "<p>Name: " . htmlspecialchars($_SESSION['name']) . "</p>";
    echo "<p>Email: " . htmlspecialchars($_SESSION['email']) . "</p>";
    echo "<p>Message: " . htmlspecialchars($_SESSION['message']) . "</p>";

    // Clear the session data
    session_unset();
    session_destroy();
} else {
    echo "<p>No form data received.</p>";
}
?>
```
